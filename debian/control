Description: Qt application for cutting parts out of DVB streams
 DVBcut is a Qt application that allows you to select certain parts of an
 MPEG transport stream (as received via Digital Video Broadcasting, DVB) and
 save these parts into a single MPEG output file. It follows a `keyhole
 surgery'' approach where the input video and audio data is mostly kept
 unchanged, and only very few frames at the beginning and/or end of the
 selected range are re-encoded in order to obtain a valid MPEG file.
