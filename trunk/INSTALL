DVBCUT INSTALL -- last edited 2009-01-24

In order to compile dvbcut, you need to have the following libraries
installed:

* Qt, version 3
* libao (optional, for sound output)
* libmad and liba52 for MP2 and AC3 decoding, respectively.

On a Debian system, the following packages should do the job: 
libqt3-mt-dev qt3-dev-tools scons libao-dev libmad0-dev liba52-0.7.4-dev

If you have MPlayer installed on your machine (and it is accessible as
"mplayer"), you can play the videos inside DVBCUT.

How to compile DVBCUT:

* Unpack the dvbcut source archive and enter the dvbcut directory.
* Type `./configure && make'. If everything works well, you will find
  the DVBCUT executable in the bin subdirectory. To install it, run
  `make install' (as root).
* Note to SVN users:
  You need to run `autoconf' in order to generate the `configure'
  script. If you're going to modify the sources, it may also be a
  good idea to run `make dep' after configuring dvbcut.
