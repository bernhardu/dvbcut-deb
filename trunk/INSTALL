DVBCUT INSTALL -- last edited 2005-11-21

In order to compile dvbcut, you need to have the following libraries
installed:

* Qt, version 3
* SCons (a modern build utility, replacing automake, autoconf and make)
* libao (optional, for sound output)

On a Debian system, the following packets should do the job: 
libqt3-mt-dev qt3-dev-tools scons libao-dev

If you have MPlayer installed on your machine (and it is accessible as
"mplayer"), you can play the videos inside DVBCUT.

How to compile DVBCUT:

* Unpack the dvbcut source archive and enter the dvbcut directory.
* Type 'make'. If everything works well, you will find the DVBCUT executable
  in the bin subdirectory.
