DVBCUT INSTALL -- last edited 2009-01-07

In order to compile dvbcut, you need to have the following libraries
installed:

* Qt, version 3
* SCons (a modern build utility, replacing automake, autoconf and make)
* libao (optional, for sound output)
* libmad and liba52 for MP2 and AC3 decoding, respectively.

On a Debian system, the following packages should do the job: 
libqt3-mt-dev qt3-dev-tools scons libao-dev libmad0-dev liba52-0.7.4-dev

If you have MPlayer installed on your machine (and it is accessible as
"mplayer"), you can play the videos inside DVBCUT.

How to compile DVBCUT:

* Unpack the dvbcut source archive and enter the dvbcut directory.
* Type `make' (for the scons build procedure), or
  `autoconf && ./configure && make' (the preferred way). If everything
  works well, you will find the DVBCUT executable in the bin
  subdirectory.
